## Version control

When creating and starting this project I made sure that Version control was used from the beginning (as seen in the commits section of the github repository). I kept up to using version control by using using Atom’s in-built Git interface. Using version control allowed me to:

•Keep my worked backed up. This was especially important during my project because there were times when installing node module where it would install wrong which meant it would crash the project. Which then allowed me to download a previous version and re-try. This especially happened during the installation of the camera endpoint.

•Keep my future self-updated on the progress of the assignment. This was especially important as during the assignment I would also have to balance completing the final year project, so would often do Mobile Application Development coursework at the start of the week and then move to the project later in the week. So, when I would return to the Assignment I would have left myself a note on the previous commit saying what was done and what needs to be done next.

•Finally, it allowed me to easily transfer between machines without having to worry if this version is the most recent version.

## Style Guide
During my assignment I was using a style guide. The style guide I chose was the JS standard because it would best match how I like to code. As my Atom was my main text editor, I could download the package from the packages area of the Atom which would then act as a linter for my work.
